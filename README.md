# RedBlackTree_Prolog

This is an implementation of a balanced search tree (red-black tree) in Prolog. This software was written for practicing purposes, so it may contain bugs/errors. At the moment all of the predicates are roughly explained in the code, but, if I find the time, a complete description of the predicates will be added to this repository. 

**The current state of the software is: UNFINISHED & UNSTABLE**

All of the software in this repository was released under the MIT License, which can be found in the 'LICENSE' file.
